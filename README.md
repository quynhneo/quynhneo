### Hi there, I am Quynh (pronounce almost like Quinn) ðŸ‘‹
- I am a physicist by training, and my main career is in physics. My GitHub is mostly about data science/machine learning projects.
- ðŸ”­ I worked on [topic modeling](https://github.com/quynhneo/detm-arxiv) and [dialect map](https://github.com/ds3-nyu-archive/ds-dialect-map) of the arxiv articles in collaboration with Professor of Physics [Kyle Cranmer](https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/faculty/kyle-s-cranmer.html), [Sinclert PÃ©rez](https://github.com/Sinclert) and [Data Science and Software Services](https://github.com/ds3-nyu-archive) at New York University.
- Open-source highlights: 
 
  Big texts and graph mining tools: [arxiv-public-datasets](https://github.com/mattbierbaum/arxiv-public-datasets). I contributed to adapting the packages to a new data pipe line from Google Cloud Service. 

  Image Processing Tools: [PIVlab](https://github.com/Shrediquette/PIVlab). This is the most popular open source Particle Image Velocimetry MATLAB program, cited in thousands of research articles. I contributed to its parallelization and the design of the command line interface. I am also a maintainer of the project.  
  
  I have also peer-reviewed for the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS).
